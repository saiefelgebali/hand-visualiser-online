# Hand Visualiser Online

A friend of mine created a glove-like device that outputs data of how the fingers are positioned.

I created this application to visualize the output data on a 3D hand model.

Since I didn't have access to the physical glove device during development, I built this app on the basis that users will join a room and control a hand using UI sliders in real-time.

## Project Demo

Here are a few videos of us demonstrating the completed project.
